#[Project #1: Helicopter Escapes](https://github.com/teraunsb/Helicopter-landing-first-guided-project/blob/main/_helicopter%20escapes%20portfolio.ipynb)
This my first guided project I did with dataquest.io. I had to implement things that I learned in earlier lessons like:
* for loops 
* indexes 
* frequency tables with two list of lists(Without Dictionaries). 
The objective was to clean the data, collect information about helicopter prison escape attempts, and to display that data with a frequency chart.

#[Project #2: App AD Analysis](https://github.com/teraunsb/App-Ad-Analysis/blob/main/_App%20Ad%20Project%20tsb.ipynb)
This project had me analyzing apps that are free and get most of their revenue through in app ads. The objective was to attract more users to a increase revenue for an imaginary company I'm working with. To do that, I needed to see what type of free apps perform well on both the IOS App Store and the Google Play Store.

#[Project #3: Hacker News Comments Analysis](https://github.com/teraunsb/Hacker-News-Comments-project/blob/main/_Hacker%20News%20tsb%20project.ipynb)
I will be comparing hacker news posts. User questions are one half of the posts, and user contributions are the other half. This project will make an inference about which one recieves more comment responses on average.


#[Project #4: Employees Exit Surveys Analysis](https://github.com/teraunsb/Employees-Exit-surveys-project/blob/main/Employee%20Exit%20surveys%20project.ipynb)
I was worked with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment(DETE) and the Technical and Further Education(TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.

I played the role of a data analyst presenting stakeholders that wanted want to know the following:

* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

The stakeholders needed me to combine the results of both surveys to answer these questions. I first had to clean the data, then get to analyzing it.


#[Project #5: Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94](https://github.com/teraunsb/I-94-Traffic-Analysis/blob/main/I-94%20traffic%20project.ipynb)
 Car accidents, bad weather, and time of day are some examples of indicators of traffic ahead. This project will dive deep into the I-94 interstate highway dataset and look for any indicators that correlate with heavy traffic. Data visualization will be implemented in this project by using matplotlib.
