# Project : [SQL CIA Factbook Analysis](https://github.com/teraunsb/SQL-CIA-Factbook-Analysis/blob/main/SQL%20CIA%20Factbook%20Project.ipynb)
In this SQL project, insights about population and area for various countries in the CIA database were obtained. The analysis covered population growth rates, identifying countries with potential demographic challenges, and distinguishing water-dominant nations. Additionally, countries with high population density relative to land area were highlighted. The findings offer the CIA a fundamental understanding of global demographics, enabling informed decision-making and policy formulation.


# Project : [Ebay Car Sales Analysis](https://github.com/teraunsb/Ebay-car-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Car_Sales_Analysis.ipynb)
The data was cleaned for better analysis, employing aggregation techniques like groupby(), nested_dictionaries, and agg(). Insights show a preference for Volkswagen cars in Germany due to affordability, reliability, and lower mileage. The Golf model is popular, and non-damaged cars are significantly more expensive.


# Project: [App AD Analysis](https://github.com/teraunsb/App-Ad-Analysis/blob/main/_App%20Ad%20Project%20tsb.ipynb)
The focus of this project was to analyze free apps that generate revenue through in-app advertisements. With the goal of attracting more users and increasing revenue for an imaginary company, I examined the performance of various types of free apps on both the IOS App Store and the Google Play Store.

# Project: [Hacker News Comments Analysis](https://github.com/teraunsb/Hacker-News-Comments-project/blob/main/_Hacker%20News%20tsb%20project.ipynb)
By comparing user questions and user contributions on Hacker News, this project aimed to infer which type of post receives more comment responses on average. Through data analysis and exploration, I uncovered insights regarding the engagement levels of different post types.

# Project: [Employees Exit Surveys Analysis](https://github.com/teraunsb/Employees-Exit-surveys-project/blob/main/Employee%20Exit%20surveys%20project.ipynb)
In this project, I worked with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. Acting as a data analyst, I addressed stakeholder questions such as the relationship between employee tenure and resignation due to dissatisfaction. By combining and analyzing the survey results, I provided valuable insights to the stakeholders.

# Project: [Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94](https://github.com/teraunsb/I-94-Traffic-Analysis/blob/main/I-94%20traffic%20project.ipynb)
Exploring the I-94 interstate highway dataset, this project aimed to identify indicators that correlate with heavy traffic. By examining factors such as car accidents, weather conditions, and time of day, I conducted data analysis and visualization using matplotlib to uncover meaningful insights about traffic patterns.

# Project: [Helicopter Escapes](https://github.com/teraunsb/Helicopter-landing-first-guided-project/blob/main/_helicopter%20escapes%20portfolio.ipynb)
In this guided project, I utilized the concepts learned in earlier lessons such as for loops, indexes, and frequency tables. The objective was to clean the data and gather information about helicopter prison escape attempts. The culmination of the project involved presenting the data through a visually informative frequency chart.
