# Project : [SQL CIA Factbook Analysis](https://github.com/teraunsb/SQL-CIA-Factbook-Analysis/blob/main/SQL%20CIA%20Factbook%20Project.ipynb)
In this SQL project, insights about population and area for various countries in the CIA database were obtained. The analysis covered population growth rates, identifying countries with potential demographic challenges, and distinguishing water-dominant nations. Additionally, countries with high population density relative to land area were highlighted. The findings offer the CIA a fundamental understanding of global demographics, enabling informed decision-making and policy formulation.


# Project : [Ebay Car Sales Analysis](https://github.com/teraunsb/Ebay-car-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Car_Sales_Analysis.ipynb)
The data was cleaned for better analysis, employing aggregation techniques like groupby(), nested_dictionaries, and agg(). Insights show a preference for Volkswagen cars in Germany due to affordability, reliability, and lower mileage. The Golf model is popular, and non-damaged cars are significantly more expensive.

# Project : [High School Data Analysis](https://github.com/teraunsb/Analyzing-NYC-High-School-Data/blob/main/High%20Schools.ipynb)
This project will be analyzing high schools in New York City. The key performance indicators(KPI's) are:

- SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City
- School attendance - Attendance information for each school in New York City
- Class size - Information on class size for each school
- AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)
- Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated and other outcome information
- Demographics - Demographic information for each school
- School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school

The main objective of this project is to see the correlation beween the demographics/school survey and the SAT scores/AP test results.

# Project : [Euro Exchange Rate Analysis](https://github.com/teraunsb/Euro-Exchange-Rate-Analysis/blob/main/Euro%20Exchange%20Rate%20Analysis.ipynb)
The dataset shown illustrates the correlation between the Euro and other currencies around the world. For example, a value in the U.S. Dollar column might say 1.6228. This means that one Euro is worth 1.6338 dollars that day. The first column has the date for every value. I will use that row to analyze and visualize correlation between currencies across a period of time. Before I do any of that, I will have to clean the data to make sure that the numbers are accurate and the data conveys a clear message. I will be using mardowns to illustrate what I'm trying to accomplish.
The data I will be working with can be found on Kaggle.

# Project: [App AD Analysis](https://github.com/teraunsb/App-Ad-Analysis/blob/main/_App%20Ad%20Project%20tsb.ipynb)
The focus of this project was to analyze free apps that generate revenue through in-app advertisements. With the goal of attracting more users and increasing revenue for an imaginary company, I examined the performance of various types of free apps on both the IOS App Store and the Google Play Store.

# Project: [Hacker News Comments Analysis](https://github.com/teraunsb/Hacker-News-Comments-project/blob/main/_Hacker%20News%20tsb%20project.ipynb)
By comparing user questions and user contributions on Hacker News, this project aimed to infer which type of post receives more comment responses on average. Through data analysis and exploration, I uncovered insights regarding the engagement levels of different post types.

# Project: [Employees Exit Surveys Analysis](https://github.com/teraunsb/Employees-Exit-surveys-project/blob/main/Employee%20Exit%20surveys%20project.ipynb)
In this project, I worked with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. Acting as a data analyst, I addressed stakeholder questions such as the relationship between employee tenure and resignation due to dissatisfaction. By combining and analyzing the survey results, I provided valuable insights to the stakeholders.

# Project: [Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94](https://github.com/teraunsb/I-94-Traffic-Analysis/blob/main/I-94%20traffic%20project.ipynb)
Exploring the I-94 interstate highway dataset, this project aimed to identify indicators that correlate with heavy traffic. By examining factors such as car accidents, weather conditions, and time of day, I conducted data analysis and visualization using matplotlib to uncover meaningful insights about traffic patterns.

# Project: [Helicopter Escapes](https://github.com/teraunsb/Helicopter-landing-first-guided-project/blob/main/_helicopter%20escapes%20portfolio.ipynb)
In this guided project, I utilized the concepts learned in earlier lessons such as for loops, indexes, and frequency tables. The objective was to clean the data and gather information about helicopter prison escape attempts. The culmination of the project involved presenting the data through a visually informative frequency chart.
