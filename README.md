#[Project #1:](https://github.com/teraunsb/Helicopter-landing-first-guided-project/blob/main/_helicopter%20escapes%20portfolio.ipynb)
This my first guided project I did with dataquest.io. I had to implement things that I learned in earlier lessons like:
* for loops 
* indexes 
* frequency tables with two list of lists(Without Dictionaries). 
The objective was to clean the data, collect information about helicopter prison escape attempts, and to display that data with a frequency chart.

#[Project #2:](https://github.com/teraunsb/App-Ad-Analysis/blob/main/_App%20Ad%20Project%20tsb.ipynb)
This project had me analyzing apps that are free and get most of their revenue through in app ads. The objective was to attract more users to a increase revenue for an imaginary company I'm working with. To do that, I needed to see what type of free apps perform well on both the IOS App Store and the Google Play Store.

#[Project #3:](https://github.com/teraunsb/Hacker-News-Comments-project/blob/main/_Hacker%20News%20tsb%20project.ipynb)
I will be comparing hacker news posts. User questions are one half of the posts, and user contributions are the other half. This project will make an inference about which one recieves more comment responses on average.


#[Project #4:](https://github.com/teraunsb/Employees-Exit-surveys-project/blob/main/Employee%20Exit%20surveys%20project.ipynb)
I will be working with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment(DETE) and the Technical and Further Education(TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.

I will play role as a data analyst and pretend that our stakeholders want to know the following:

Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
The stakeholders will need me to combine the results of both surveys to answer these questions. I will need to clean the data, then get to analyzing it.
